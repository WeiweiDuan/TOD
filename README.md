A Target Guided Generative Clustering Model for Spatial Object Detection from Weak Annotations

This repository is the official implementation of A Target Guided Generative Clustering Model for Spatial Object Detection from Weak Annotations. 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
sudo nvidia-docker run -t -i -v /folder/:/folder/ -p 8888:8888 spatialcomputing/map_text_recognition_gpu /bin/bash
```

> ðŸ“‹Run above command to set up the environment
## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```data generation
python data_gen.py --training_data_folder <path_to_data> --image <path_to_image> --mask <path_to_annotation>
```

```train
python train.py --target_samples_folder <path_to_data> --image <path_to_image> --mask <path_to_annotation> --weight 1000
```

> ðŸ“‹Use data_gen.py to get 30% data as training data, and the user choose a target sample and put it to the target sample folder.
> ðŸ“‹Use train.py to train TOD.

## Evaluation

To detect target objects, run:

```eval
python test.py --model-file mymodel.pth --image <path_to_image>
```

> ðŸ“‹Use the trained model to detect objects on the entire annotated area.


## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on cars detection in parking lots:

|       | Parking lot 1      | Parking lot 2      | Parking lot 3      |
| ------|------------------- |------------------- | -------------------|
|       |precision | recall  |precision | recall  |precision | recall  |
| ------|------------------- |------------------- | -------------------|
| TOD   |95.00%.   | 88.68%  |78.57%.   |92.86%.  |93.20%.    |93.70%. |
